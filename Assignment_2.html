      How is Tap Water Treated?
    </h2>
<p style="text-align:left"><img src="http://www.beachesliving.ca/pages/static/Landmarks/images07FW/07_06_water_treatment_flow.jpg"></p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <strong>Lake Ontario</strong>-The water intake pipes extend
        into Lake Ontario and collect raw water. In some areas of
        the city, large intake pipes extend as far as 5 kilometers
        offshore.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Screening</strong>- At the entrance of the plant we
        use travelling screens to remove large objects and debris.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Chlorine</strong>- It's added to the incoming lake
        water to kill microorganisms. This stage is called
        pre-chlorination. Alum is also added to the water and it
        causes small particles such as silt to clump together. The
        chemicals are mechanically mixed into the water to form
        larger groups of particles called "floc".
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Settling Basin</strong>- Heavy flocs drop out of
        the water in a settling tank and collect along the bottom.
        These are removed from the water. The cleaner water is let
        a the surface to be drawn off through spillways, which lead
        to filtering basins.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Filtration</strong>- Filters are made up of layers
        of graded gravel, fine sand and carbon or anthracite- a
        coal-like mineral. The layer of sand removes fine bits of
        floc, algae, and silt. Other chemical and physical
        impurities and most of the biological impurities (bacteria)
        are removed. The layer of activated carbon removes taste
        and odour-producing chemical from the water.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Storage</strong>- The purified water does into
        holding basins prior to distribution. Safe levels of
        chlorine are added to kill any remaining harmful
        micro-organisms and then excess chlorine is removed with
        sulfur dioxide. The City of Toronto adds fluoride to the
        water during the treatment process to help prevent
        cavities.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Ammonia</strong>- The last step in the treatment
        process to to add ammonia to the water. Ammonia combines
        with the remaining chlorine to stabilize the chlorine and
        keep the water safe during its trip from the plant, through
        distribution pipes to people's homes and businesses.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Testing</strong>- The treated water is tested
        regularly to ensure quality.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Distribution</strong>- With the help of high lift
        pumps, reservoirs, and pumping stations, water is
        distributed to homes, apartments, schools, and industries.
      </li>

      This is the R.C Harris water Treatment Plant located 
      in Toronto, Ontario along the east of the city at the eastern
      end of Queen Street and at the foot of Victoria Park Avenue
      along the shore of Lake Ontario. It provides approximately
      45% of the water supply for Toronto and York Region.</mark></pre>

      Why Do We Need to Treat Water?
    </h2>
    <p>
      We need to treat water because there are many impurities in
      the raw lake water that can harm human health if the water is
      ingested without treatment.
    </p>
    <p>
      These impurities are grouped into three categories:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Physical</strong>: materials that do not dissolve
        in the water and make the water appear "dirty".
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Chemical</strong>: substances dissolved in the
        water from both natural and man-made processes.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Biological</strong>: viruses, bacteria, algae, and
        other small living organisms.
      </li>
    </ul>
